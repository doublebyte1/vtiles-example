# README

Minimal implementation of a javascript client for OGC API - tiles, using leaflet.js. The client is reading two vector tile layers from the [eMOTIONAL Cities catalogue](https://emotional.byteroad.net/catalogue), published using [pygeoapi](https://pygeoapi.io/) with a [elasticsearch provider](https://docs.pygeoapi.io/en/latest/data-publishing/ogcapi-tiles.html#mvt-elastic).

There is also code for loading feature layers and benchmarking the application start using either tiles or features. You can read more about this experiment on [doublebyte.net](https://doublebyte.net).
